1
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Grease and flour two 8-inch round cake pans and line the bottoms with rounds of parchment paper to fit. Set aside.

2
In a stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment, cream together the butter and sugar until they are light and fluffy. Gradually add the eggs, one at a time, beating completely in with each addition. Also, add the mayonnaise and vanilla and beat once more.

3
In a separate large bowl, combine the self-raising flour, cocoa powder, and salt.

4
In a liquid measuring cup, pour the buttermilk, apple cider vinegar, and red food coloring. Add the flour and buttermilk mixtures into the flour and sugar mixture alternatively beginning and ending with the flour. Mix the batter until it is just combined and all the flour is hydrated. Turn off the mixer.

5
Distribute the batter evenly between the two prepared cake tins. Bake in a preheated oven for 55-60 minutes or until a cake tester comes out clean.

6
Remove the cakes from the oven and allow them to cool for 15 minutes before turning out onto a cooling rack to cool completely.

7
Once the cakes are cooled, make the frosting. Cream together the softened cream cheese and butter until combined. Slowly add the powdered sugar and vanilla. Blend until fluffy and fully combined.

8
Lay your first cake layer onto a cake plate. Frost the top with about Â¼-inch thickness of frosting. Top your frosting with the final cake layer and frost the top. Add more frosting to gradually pushing the excess down the sides of the cake.

Refrigerate the cake until ready to serve.
